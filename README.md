# DisbursementsApp

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

# Solution explanations

- After you will run the project you can access those pages by url or by jso
1. Merchants
3. Shoppers
4. Orders
5. Disbursements 

- For viewing json you can simply go thru /api for each of the pages and also you can use /api/swagger in order to test the json for
/api/disbursements_by_merchant?merchant_id={merchant_id}&week={week} by entering the number of week and merchant_id
   - Json swagger path: http://localhost:4000/api/swagger
      - /api/disbursements_by_merchant?merchant_id={merchant_id}&week={week}
      
      (ex. /api/disbursements_by_merchant?merchant_id=1&week=1)
      
   - Other api paths: 
      - http://localhost:4000/api/shoppers
      - http://localhost:4000/api/merchants
      - http://localhost:4000/api/orders
      - http://localhost:4000/api/disbursements
- I have created one more model/controller Disbursements in order to store Disbursements that are created 
 
 In the controller Disbursements I have inputed manually start_last_week and end_last_week because if I set up them as they should be there will be no data for checking as there are no orders in the past week.
   
    start_f = ~D[2018-02-01]
    
    end_f =  ~D[2018-02-07]
   
  So you can put period of time you want in order to calculcate the disbursment in the past.
  
  - Also to make the calculation you need to go to the link http://localhost:4000/calculate or when you go in Disbursements just click on calculate disbursements and they will be calculated in background.
  - There are two functions important for doing calculations
    - calc_amount() that calculate the fee for disbursement
    - calculate() that is doing the caclulations and make the scheduler for the period of calculations
    
- I decided to use decimal instead of floats type to have more precission and are used when dealing with money.

# Improvements

## Crontab

Adding task to the crontab to be performed all mondays

## Log

A system to log the merchants processed and succesfull calculations.

## API auth

Add a token to API request

# Backend coding challenge
This is the coding challenge for people who applied to a backend developer position at SeQura. It's been designed to be a simplified version of the same problems we deal with.

## The challenge
SeQura provides ecommerce shops (merchants) a flexible payment method so their customers (shoppers) can purchase and receive goods without paying upfront. SeQura earns a small fee per purchase and pays out (disburse) the merchant once the order is marked as completed.

The operations manager is now asking you to make a system to calculate how much money should be disbursed to each merchant based on the following rules:

* Disbursements are done weekly on Monday.
* We disburse only orders which status is completed.
* The disbursed amount has the following fee per order:
  * 1% fee for amounts smaller than 50 ???
  * 0.95% for amounts between 50??? - 300???
  * 0.85% for amounts over 300???

We expect you to:

* Create the necessary data structures and a way to persist them for the provided data. You don't have to follow our schema if you think another one suits better.
* Calculate and persist the disbursements per merchant on a given week. As the calculations can take some time it should be isolated and be able to run independently of a regular web request, for instance by running a background job.
* Create an API endpoint to expose the disbursements for a given merchant on a given week. If no merchant is provided return for all of them.

Find attached the merchants (https://www.dropbox.com/s/wms8dlqzs6bqkul/backend%20challenge%20dataset.zip?dl=0), shoppers and orders data on both json and csv files, use whatever it's easier for you. They follow this structure:

## Instructions
* Please read carefully the challenge and if you have any doubt or need extra info please don't hesitate to ask us before starting.
* You shouldn't spend more than 3h on the challenge.
* Design, test, develop and document the code. It should be a performant, clean and well structured solution. Then send us a link or a zip with a git repo.
* You should consider this code ready for production as it were a PR to be reviewed by a colleague. Also commit as if it were a real assignment.
* Remember you're dealing with money, so you should be careful with related operations.
* Create a README explaining how to setup and run your solution and a short explanation of your technical choices, tradeoffs, ...
* You don't need to finish. We value quality over feature-completeness. If you have to leave things aside you can mention them on the README explaining why and how you would resolve them.
* You can code the solution in a language of your choice, here are some technologies we are more familiar with (no particular order): JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Go, Elixir, Java, Scala, PHP.
